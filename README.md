# Number-Guessing-Game
Developed a console-based number guessing game that generates a random number (1-100) and provide interactive feedback (too high / too low) until the correct guess is made.  Implemented input validation to ensure valid numerical entries and added attempt tracking to display performance upon successful completion.
